# Quantum MERN Project

## Introduction
Quantum MERN is an innovative project that blends the power of quantum computing with the robustness of the MERN stack. This project aims to explore how quantum computing can revolutionize web application development, utilizing Rust and Qiskit as core technologies.

## Concept
The project integrates MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js with quantum computing principles. It leverages Rust for backend development and Qiskit for quantum computations, interfacing these with the traditional MERN stack.

## Technologies
- **MERN Stack:** MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js
- **Quantum Computing:** Qiskit
- **Backend Development:** Rust

## Getting Started
Instructions will be placed for setting up the project, installing dependencies, etc.
